			I like playing computer games. My favorite ones are Counterstrike and Starcraft and Call of duty. Believe it or not, I have accumulated over more than 5,000 hours of game time all throughout. I do enjoy it and that's why I could stay up all night and let time pass by without me noticing it. It all started when I got introduced to gaming when I was a young kid.I grew up in a small town in the Philippines and there, kids would normally go to computer cafes to have gaming tournaments. It was very competitive and fun as hell. All the young people in the town would congregate on that cafe where they have like hundreds of desktop computers dedicated for gaming. The place would be filled with screams, laughter and youthful fun especially after school hours. I won a couple of tournaments back then and eversince then, gaming has been a part of my life. <br>
			People often say that nothing good can come from playing video games. But I beg to differ because based in my experience, playing computer games made me a good team-player. Good coordination and communication is required in order to win in these games. Playing computer games allowed me to develop my decision-making and critical thinking skills and at the same time, have some fun while doing so. <br>
			But enough of computer games and more about the person. I am a shy quiet individual. People who do not know me personally would consider me as aloof, but my friends would say that I am extremely approachable and kind-hearted. If I am not in the cafe, I would normally be found working in our family farm back in the Philippines. We mainly grew rice and raised poultry. I was basically in charge of raising our chickens and selling them in the market. This was all I ever did back then after finishing high school. In that part of the world, there is not that much opportunity and the main industry in most provinces is just agriculture. Nontheless, I tried to get myself educated through reading and browsing the internet. The internet is a treasure trove of knowledge and anything can be possible with the help of this technology. So here I am today, taking up this Software Engineering class and hoping for a brighter future.<br>

		<h3> A sad Story </h3>
			<div class="threecolumn">
		Back in November 2013, a Super-Typhoon devasted my hometown. It had winds of up to 200 miles per hour and it just blasted everything along its way. We lost our home, our farm and basically everything else. All our belongings, photo albums and memories got washed up with the flood. We ended up living like refugees but somehow, we were grateful to still be alive since many unfortunately lost their lives during that event. Even though we were homeless and devasted, we somehow managed to rebuild what we lost, little by little. Living in a not so prosperous country is really tough, but we don't really have a choice. If tragedy hits you in the face, it's either you stand back up, or give up in shame. Despite all horrendous experiences that I had in my life, I did somehow manage to get something positive out of it. I learned how to be resourceful and be determined. I have also discovered that, if you can survive a near-death tragedy, then you can basically take on any challenge in your life.

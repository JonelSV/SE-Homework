	<p class="float">My name is Jonel but my friends call me Jon for short. I am originally from the Philippines and now, I live here in Boston. I am passionate about technology in general. My interest in computers and technology began when  I was kid. My brother gifted to me a personal computer and back then, it was my ultimate joy. I did a lot of tinkering with it and also spent an enormous amount of time playing computer games. I am an avid PC gamer and it was my dream to become a professional esports player. Unfortunately, that did not work out. Life takes you to unexpected places and taks drastic turns. That being said, my fascination with technology is still within my spirit. I now dream to become a successful software engineer in the future and hopefully, I would be able to make webesites, apps, software and even computer games myself. </p>

			Apart from gaming, I am also into a lot of different things.  I like learning random things and exploring new interests every now and then. I am into travelling as well and I do enjoy learning about different places and cultures.</p>
